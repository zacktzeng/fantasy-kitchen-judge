I created a Moonlit Lavender Venison Roast, using tender cuts of venison marinated in juniper berry wine and slow-roasted over elderwood embers. The meat is plated atop a puree of moon tubers and garnished with caramelized ghost onions and crushed frostpetal blossoms. A drizzle of fermented dew honey reduction completes the dish. The recipe is inspired by a mythic winter hunt beneath a lunar eclipse.
