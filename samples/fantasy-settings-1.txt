Use stricter standards for presentation:
- Deduct points if the visual imagery is confusing or contains modern elements.

Increase scrutiny on flavor synergy:
- Deduct up to 2 points if ingredient combinations are unconventional without justification.

Emphasize storytelling bonus:
- Only give 5/5 bonus if the dish ties into a local legend or cultural event.
